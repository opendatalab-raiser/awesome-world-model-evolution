## 🎯 Introduction

### What is a World Model?

A **World Model** is a computational system that learns the intrinsic laws governing our physical world and constructs an executable, dynamic simulation environment internally. Unlike conventional AI models that merely perform pattern matching or classification, a world model serves as an **internal simulator** capable of:

- 🔄 **Reproducing** observed events and phenomena
- 🎲 **Predicting** future states and outcomes
- 🤔 **Reasoning** about counterfactual scenarios (what-if analysis)
- 🎯 **Planning** long-term strategies based on simulated consequences

**Why World Models Matter:**

World models are considered a cornerstone toward achieving **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**:

- 🤖 **Embodied AI**: Robots can "rehearse" actions before execution
- 🚗 **Autonomous Systems**: Simulation of hazardous edge cases for safer deployment
- 🔬 **Scientific Discovery**: Accelerated understanding of complex systems through digital experimentation
- 🎮 **Interactive Environments**: Creation of controllable, physics-aware virtual worlds

### The Three Fundamental Consistencies

A fully functional world model must master three core competencies, which we term the **Three Fundamental Consistencies**:

#### 1️⃣ **Modality Consistency**
![modality](./assets/m.jpg)
The "linguistic interface" between the model and reality.

- **Capability**: Bidirectional translation between high-dimensional sensory inputs (images, video, audio) and abstract symbolic representations (language, structured data)
- **Example Tasks**: Image captioning, text-to-image generation, visual question answering
- **Significance**: Enables the world model to receive instructions and communicate observations in human-interpretable formats

#### 2️⃣ **Spatial Consistency**
![spatial](./assets/s.jpg)
The "static 3D comprehension" of the physical world.

- **Capability**: Understanding that objects possess fixed geometric forms, occupy space, exhibit occlusion relationships, and maintain identity across viewpoints
- **Example Tasks**: Novel view synthesis, 3D reconstruction, multi-view consistency
- **Significance**: Forms the foundational "scene graph" enabling accurate spatial reasoning and navigation

#### 3️⃣ **Temporal Consistency**
![temporal](./assets/t.jpg)
The "physics engine" for dynamic simulation.

- **Capability**: Modeling how the world evolves over time, including object motion, physical interactions, and causal event chains
- **Example Tasks**: Video prediction, dynamics modeling, future state forecasting
- **Significance**: Enables anticipation of consequences and long-term planning capabilities

### Why Unified Multimodal Models?

This repository traces the evolution toward world models through **Unified Multimodal Models** (particularly Large Multimodal Models - LMMs), which we argue represent the most promising pathway forward:

**Key Advantages:**

- 🏗️ **Architectural Unity**: A central processing core (LLM backbone) with modular sensory interfaces naturally facilitates cross-modal integration
- ✨ **Emergent Understanding**: Pre-training on massive, diverse multimodal datasets enables implicit learning of world regularities rather than relying on manually engineered rules
- 📈 **Scalability**: Demonstrated scaling laws suggest capabilities improve predictably with increased parameters, data, and compute
- 🔄 **Synergistic Learning**: Different consistencies can emerge and reinforce each other through joint training

**Our Thesis:** End-to-end trained unified models are superior to task-specific specialized models for building world models, as they can learn the deep interconnections between modalities, space, and time.

## 🔬 Independent Exploration: Specialized Models

Before the era of unified models, researchers pursued a "divide-and-conquer" approach, developing specialized architectures for each consistency challenge. This foundational work established key techniques and insights that inform current unified approaches.

### <a href="./consisency-paper/modality-consistency/README.md">Modality Consistency</a>

**Objective**: Establish bidirectional mappings between symbolic (language) and perceptual (vision) representations.

**Historical Significance**: These models created the first "symbol-perception bridges," solving the fundamental I/O problem for world models.

## 📊 <a href="./consisency-paper/benchmarks+evaluation/README.md">Benchmarks and Evaluation</a>

**Current Challenge**: Existing metrics (FID, FVD, CLIP Score) inadequately assess world model capabilities, focusing on perceptual quality rather than physical understanding.

**Need for Comprehensive Benchmarks:**

A true world model benchmark should evaluate:
- 🧩 **Commonsense Physics Understanding**: Does the model respect gravity, momentum, conservation laws?
- 🔮 **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Can it predict outcomes of hypothetical interventions?
- ⏳ **Long-term Consistency**: Does coherence break down over extended simulation horizons?
- 🎯 **Goal-Directed Planning**: Can it chain actions to achieve complex objectives?
- 🎛️ **Controllability**: How precisely can users manipulate simulated elements?
