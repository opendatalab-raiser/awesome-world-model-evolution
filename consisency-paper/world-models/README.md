## 🌟 The "Trinity" Prototype: Emerging World Models

This section highlights models that demonstrate **preliminary integration of all three consistencies**, exhibiting emergent world model capabilities. These systems represent the current frontier, showing glimpses of true world simulation.

### Text-to-World Generators

Models that generate dynamic, spatially consistent virtual environments from language descriptions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Modality: Natural language understanding and pixel-space generation
- ✅ Spatial: 3D-aware scene composition with object permanence
- ✅ Temporal: Physically plausible dynamics and motion

<summary><b>OpenAI Sora</b></summary>

* **Authors:** OpenAI Research Team
* **Model:** Sora (2024)
* **One-liner:** A large-scale space-time generative model that treats videos as sequences of visual patches, enabling high-fidelity text-to-video, image-to-video, and video editing.
* **Published in:** 2024 (open release)
* **Links:** [[Model Page]](https://openai.com/sora) | [[Technical Overview]](https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/)

> **Core Innovation**  
> Sora introduces a large-scale universal generative model that treats visual data (e.g., videos) as “patches,” supporting multiple input modalities (text, images, videos) and outputting new videos with flexible durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios.

<details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Sora is a general visual generation model capable of synthesizing videos and images across diverse durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios. It leverages a spatiotemporal representation of visual data and trains on patches, similar to token-based language models. Sora supports flexible conditioning (text, image, video) and demonstrates strong temporal coherence, physical realism, and camera motion control, pointing toward scalable video models as world simulators.

<details>
    <summary>Key points</summary>
    * Treats video as patch-based latent sequences (analogous to tokenization in LLMs)  
    * Unified model for video & image generation across resolutions and durations  
    * Strong physical consistency and camera control  
    * Supports text → video, image → video, video editing, and stylization
